# flipperzero-dotkiller-fap     
Clean .dotfiles left behind after plugging FLIPPER SD into macOS system directly from you Flipper Zero

This FAP (Flipper APplication) do the same work that the "dotclean" shell's command do on macOS.      
It cleans up all the useless ".dotfiles" that apps such as "Time Machine" creates on a external drive, everytime you put stuffs from macOS to the external drive. (These files will be visibles in the Flipper Zero's browser and various archives as e "._copy" of every files you dragged and dropped on your FLIPPER SD.        

Since i am not a C developer and I'm doing this also to learn how to interface me with embedded devices, and C programming WHOEVER want to help me modifying the Fap, implemnting stuff and expanding his main goal, IS WELCOME and it would be very appreciate.

That's it that's all. Thank you very much!!
