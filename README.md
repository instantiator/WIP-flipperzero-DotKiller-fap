# flipperzero-dotkiller-fap     
Clean in one click, directly from your Flipper Zero all the .hiddenfiles, stored in your Device, after plugging the FLIPPER SD card into macOS system. 

This FAP (Flipper APplication) do the same work that the "dotclean" shell's command do on macOS.      
It cleans up all the useless ".dotfiles" that apps such as "Time Machine" creates on a external drive, everytime you put stuffs from macOS to the external drive. (These files will be visibles in the Flipper Zero's browser and various archives as e "._copy" of every files you dragged and dropped on your FLIPPER SD.        

Since i am not a C developer and I'm doing this also to learn how to interface me with embedded devices, and C programming WHOEVER want to help me modifying the Fap, implemnting stuff and expanding his main goal, IS WELCOME and it would be very appreciate.

# Todo:  
  
- [ ] Adding deleting process animation
- [ ] Add end process confirmation (vibro, sound and led light).     
- [ ] Adding personal image to confirm the cancellation.      
- [ ] Add an advice (maybe a graphical too) if there are no files to delete.     
- [ ] In the lower right space, replace the 'back' button with 'settings', in which will be present:    

  - select only one folder in which search/cancel files.   
  - set a period to automatically run the app (dayly/weekly/monthly).   
  - select only vibro/sound/led or only two, or all of them to confirm the finish.    
  - info/about.
  - exit. (possible also keeping pressed the Back button)


That's it that's all. Thank you very much!!
